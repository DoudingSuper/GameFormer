## Overview
What you can expect in this repository ðŸ¤Ÿ:
* Code for interaction prediction (joint model) on WOMD
* Code for open-loop planning on selected scenarios on WOMD
* For the closed-loop planning on the nuPlan dataset, please go to [GameFormer Planner](https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer-Planner)

What you might not find in this repository ðŸ˜µ:
* Code for interaction prediction (marginal model with EM ensemble)
* Code for closed-loop planning on WOMD, please refer to our previous work [DIPP](https://github.com/MCZhi/DIPP)
* Code to pack and submit the prediction results to the WOMD Interaction Prediction Challenge
