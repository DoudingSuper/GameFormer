## Overview
In this repository, you can expect to find the following features:

Included ðŸ¤Ÿ:
* Code for interaction prediction using a joint model on WOMD
* Code for open-loop planning on selected scenarios on WOMD

Not included ðŸ˜µ:
* Code for the marginal model with EM ensemble for interaction prediction on WOMD
* Code for closed-loop planning on WOMD. For that, please refer to our previous work [DIPP](https://github.com/MCZhi/DIPP)
* Code to pack and submit the prediction results to the WOMD Interaction Prediction Challenge

For experimentation on the nuPlan dataset, please visit the [GameFormer Planner](https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer-Planner) repository, which provides a more comprehensive planning framework.
